## Electronic Design

This project consists of 2 main Printec Circuit Boards (PCB)pcbs: RPI adaptor and Sensor PCb.

#RPI adaptor

The feature of this pcb is to connect the correct RPI pines to the sensor circuit that we are using. We need to guide all the signal through a RJ45 cable that is going to the sensor pcb. Thus, it is need to adapt and guide signal in the correct order. 

The pcbs are shown below:
