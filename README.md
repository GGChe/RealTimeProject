### Introduction


According to the World Health Organisation, mental disorders are a main topic in global health, specially because one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. It is estimated that more that 450 million people are currently suffering from such disorders, placing this risk to the top of all the ill-health's causes and disability worldwide. The main mental disorder is depression, and in many situations it is caused by stress. Nowadays, stress is a risk that every person need to face in some point of the day, like work, house, friends, etc. 

There is evidence available that supports the fact that the stress is one of the main triggers of depression. More in detail , such evidence shows that depression can stem from chronic overstimulation of the body's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which produces cortisol in humans. However, while adults can face the stress with therapy and different skills, children are a very enthreaten sector of the population that does not own skills against that. 

With the mentioned before, we can imagine that one of the most risky situations for a child are videogames where we set an unprepared person against a stressfull and addictive situation, causing severe damage on the child. 

Then, this project constitutes a reliable and attractive solution for parents, therapists and adults that want to monitor and control the stress status of the player.

The device consists of the next components:
- Raspberry Pi
- PCB adaptor
- Wrist sensor

#### 1. First step. Installation

To deploy and starts working with this device, we need to follow some steps.
